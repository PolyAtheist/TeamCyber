How to get the scm file to work in gimp:
	take the scm file, and place it into:
	.gimp-2.8 -> scripts
	
Then, open gimp, and choose:
	Filters -> Script-Fu -> refresh scripts

Then, some settings have to be set:
	The opacity of the Pencil should be set to 20
	The size of the brush must be larger than the text font (use the myBrush brush, it will be created when neon Text is run)

Once those are set, you can find the function under:
		File->Create->Text->Neon Text
